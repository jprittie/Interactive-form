##Interactive form
*Project 3 of Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript course*

###Project objectives
Add interactivity and validation to a conference registration form. Validation includes checking the format of email addresses and credit card numbers. Specific objectives include:

* Adding focus to the first text field when the page loads.
* Revealing text fields and dropdowns when certain options are selected.
* Ensuring users can't choose two workshops held at the same time by disabling conflicting options.
* Creating a running total cost of the activities a user has selected.
* Display relevant payment sections when a payment option is chosen.

####Form validation
Display error messages and don't let the user submit the form if any of these validation errors exist:
* Name field can't be empty.
* Email field must be a validly formatted e-mail address.
* At least one activity must be checked from the list under "Register for Actitivities."
* Payment option must be selected.
* If "Credit card" is the selected payment option, make sure the user supplied a credit card number, a
zip code, and a three-number CVV value.
* Check the credit card number to make sure it's entered in a valid format.
